## Position Drift $C_l$

Code to calculate the angular power spectrum of position drift fluctuations as described in [arxiv:2510.05956](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05956)

For a $\Lambda$ CDM universe:

> cl.py

### Requirements

The code requires the library [FFTLog-and-beyond](https://github.com/xfangcosmo/FFTLog-and-beyond)
and the python version of [CLASS](http://class-code.net/) which can be installed using

	pip install classy
